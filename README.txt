Polestar 0.3.6
Leveling guides for World of Warcraft: Forever.

Install
1. Copy these folders from the zip into
   World of Warcraft/_forever_/Interface/AddOns/
   (_classic_beta_ instead of _forever_ on the beta client):
     Polestar
     Polestar_Guides
     Polestar_Nav
     Polestar_Nav_EK
     Polestar_Nav_Kalimdor
     Polestar_Guides_Alliance
     Polestar_Guides_Horde
     Polestar_Guides_Human
     Polestar_Guides_Orc
     Polestar_Guides_Dwarf
     Polestar_Guides_NightElf
     Polestar_Guides_Scourge
     Polestar_Guides_Tauren
     Polestar_Guides_Gnome
     Polestar_Guides_Troll
     Polestar_Guides_Skyborne
     Polestar_QuestDB
     Polestar_ItemDB
     Polestar_Codex
     Polestar_deDE
     Polestar_esES
     Polestar_esMX
     Polestar_frFR
     Polestar_koKR
     Polestar_ptBR
     Polestar_ruRU
     Polestar_zhCN
     Polestar_zhTW
   They are all part of Polestar: Polestar_Codex holds what Lookup,
   Dungeons and Rares show; Polestar_Nav the arrow's walking routes
   (Shortest Path Forever's pathing, by Cillian Berragan, GPL-3.0 or
   later: see its LICENSE and CREDITS.md); the language folders
   (Polestar_deDE, Polestar_frFR, ...) the guide texts and the game's
   quest, NPC, object and item names in each language (the game loads
   only its own). To update, delete the old Polestar folders there
   first, the Polestar_Guides_deDE and Polestar_Names_deDE kind too
   (one of each per language): Polestar no longer uses them.
2. Quit the game completely and start it again. A /reload does not
   load new addon folders.

Polestar_Recorder (a separate zip) is optional: it records your sessions
to improve the routes and stays off until you turn it on.
